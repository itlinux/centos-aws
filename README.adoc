= Deploy Two CentOS 7 using Terraform

This deploys two new CentOS VMs with Docker using Terraform in AWS.

== Credentials

Using AWS profile from your ~/.aws/credentials file


My Example:
----
[default]
access_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
secret_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

[avi]
aws_access_key_id = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
aws_secret_access_key = "XXXXXXXXXXXX"

== Use the terraform.tfvars.example
This file will need to contain your info which sets the variables. Just copy it to terraform.tfvars and update the options.
